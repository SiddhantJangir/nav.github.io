//DataTypes:
/**
 * What are DataTypes?
 *      Datatypes are types which tell a container to what to store in it like we
 *      use a bucket to store water or paint or any liquid material
 * 
 *      Exectly like that we use datatypes to tell the container(Variables) to store what in it
 *      like it can be a number or a string(a set of characters of english) etc
 * 
 *      some of the datatypes are :
 * 
 *          1.String:
 *              A String is a Set of Characters
 * 
 *          2.Int       
 *              An int is an integer/set of integers
